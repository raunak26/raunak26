# 👋 Hi, I'm Raunak Anand

I'm a software engineer passionate about building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems. Most recently, I worked on AI infrastructure at Microsoft, where I built large-scale evaluation platforms for M365 Copilot — helping teams ship LLM features with confidence and reliability.

## 👀 Interests
- AI infrastructure, LLM evaluation, and agent workflows  
- Scalable backend systems & clean developer platforms  
- Startups, product thinking, and making complex tools feel simple  

## 🌱 Currently Exploring
- Multi-agent orchestration and AI-native developer tools  
- Evaluating and deploying RAG & retrieval pipelines at scale  
- Building Cornucopia — a YC-style startup to automate biotech labs

## 💡 Looking to Collaborate On
- Open-source AI tooling (LLM eval, observability, agents)  
- Infra projects with real-world product impact  
- Biotech + automation crossovers (liquid handlers, protocol DSLs)
